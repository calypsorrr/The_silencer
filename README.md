# The_silencer
In this project we will be making a sound monitoring system for our school library.
We will mesure the sound made by the studens and we will display a warning when they exeed the sound limit.
This warning will be displayed on a LED Matrix.
We will use an Arduino Uno Wi-Fi rev2 for this project.



Parts we use:
